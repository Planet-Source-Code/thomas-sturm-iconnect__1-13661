</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">so, what is it good for, then? well, 
  Iconnect is a so-called IP-publisher. It publishes your current IP by uploading 
  it on an ftp-server. Hmm, you don&acute;t seem too impressed. How about &quot;it 
  enables you to access your computer anywhere, anytime, even though you&acute;re 
  only using a slow dial-up connection&quot;. Sounds better?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">hardware requirements</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All you need is a computer that supports 
  &quot;wake up on modem call&quot; via BIOS - or rather &quot;Advanced Power 
  Management&quot; (APM). This should be the case for any vaguely modern computer: 
  1998 and up will do. If you&acute;re not sure, check it out: while your computer 
  is booting, it shows the following message:</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Press &lt;del&gt; to enter SETUP</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(or something similar). Go ahead, 
  press &quot;del&quot; and see what happens. You should be confronted with a 
  jungle of options...don&acute;t panic! although, at this point, I somehow feel 
  compelled to utter the usual sermon: &quot;<i>this software is published without 
  any warranty whatsoever...</i>&quot; I don&acute;t. We&acute;re adults, aren&acute;t 
  we? the actual names of these options might vary from one BIOS to the other, 
  but the one we&acute;re keen on should be found among something like</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Power Management Setup</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Award-BIOS). Once you got there, 
  you should find an option called</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">PWR up on Modem Act</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">after marvelling at the capitalization 
  there, use the &quot;page up&quot; and &quot;page down&quot; keys to change 
  it to &quot;enabled&quot; - if that&acute;s not already the case. Follow the 
  instructions of your BIOS manufacturer to save the changes and reboot. If you 
  didn&acute;t change anything else, you&acute;ll be back in windows a minute 
  later. Turn your modem off and shutdown your system. When your computer is off, 
  simply switch your modem ON again. Your system should now boot up, too. If that&acute;s 
  not the case but your computer supports APM, it would be time to consult your 
  mainboards manual: might be a jumper to be set but I can&acute;t help you there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">software requirements</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You&acute;re still reading? well, 
  this means nothing less than you being able to boot your computer from anywhere 
  by just calling your own phone number. Now, at <a href="http://www.tridiavnc.com">http://www.tridiavnc.com</a> 
  (or <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/</a>, 
  for that matter) you will find a free (open source!) exiting tool, which lets 
  you remotely access your computer via any JAVA-capable browser. You simply get 
  to work with your desktop through someone elses browser. Without having to install 
  anything on the remote computer (and even if the remote computer is running 
  Linux/Unix or whatever). Get it and install it, is what I would suggest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">...and what do I need your 
  program for?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the only thing that&acute;s missing 
  is a link: you can remotely boot your computer, but...it doesn&acute;t go online 
  by itself, does it? and if so, you still don&acute;t know it&acute;s IP-adress. 
  And even if you did, what happened if you were on the other end of the world 
  but for some reason couldn&acute;t connect your computer (and therefore couldn&acute;t 
  disconnect it from the internet, let alone shut it down again). And then, like 
  every screen-oriented remote admin tool, VNC works most efficient with low resolution 
  and 8 or 16 Bit colour depth - but that&acute;s not a good enough reason to 
  <i>always</i> only use 800 * 600 pixels, 16 Bit? well, <i>now</i> we&acute;re 
  talking. I hope you will like this.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">Quickstart</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unzip and run. If your modem is OFF, 
  absolutely nothing will happen. This is a feature :-)</font><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your modem is ON, however, you 
  might see the following:</font></p>
<p><img src="Iconnect.gif" width="303" height="136"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">don&acute;t worry about the language 
  for now. We&acute;ll be able to fix that. If the countdown ticks off and nothing 
  happens, open your Internet Explorer, go to &quot;Extra&quot; (MSIE 5.x) or 
  &quot;View&quot; (MSIE 4.x), select &quot;internet options&quot; and click on 
  the connection-tab. You should see a list of your dial up connections. Select 
  one (preferably a reliable one) and make it your <i>default connection</i>. 
  <b>Iconnect will always work with your default connection unless you&acute;re 
  using a dialer program.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you&acute;re launching the program 
  now, it should wait for the countdown to finish and launch your dial up connection 
  dialog. It will then connect you to your ISP (the one appearing underneath the 
  screen resolution: Microsoft Network (MSN) in this case) and post your current 
  IP adress via ftp to:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ftp://members.nbci.com/myaccount</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For rather obvious reasons, this 
  is the first thing you will want to change before really using the program. 
  You will also notice that the countdown has changed. It&acute;s ticking down 
  5 minutes now. The line underneath the screen resolution displays your current 
  IP-adress on the internet. If you now click on <a href="%3Cfont%20face=%22Arial,%20Helvetica,%20sans-serif%22%3Ehttp://members.nbci.com/defaultaccount/index2.htm%3C/font%3E">http://members.nbci.com/myaccount/index2.htm</a> 
  you should see this:</font></p>
<p><img src="html01.gif" width="304" height="81"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">appearing in your browser window. 
  Obviously, local date and time will be <i>your</i> local date and time, as well 
  as the link appearing after &quot;current ip:&quot; will match the IP-adress 
  displayed in Iconnect. This is the &quot;page&quot; just posted by Iconnect. 
  Since anyone on the internet can see this, it would be a good idea to make a 
  few changes...</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note: </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  am not trying to advert <a href="http://www.nbci.com">NBCI</a> here: this is 
  merely an example to show how Iconnect can be used. However, since you can get 
  free webspace with ftp-account at NBCI (within a few minutes), it might be worth 
  checking out. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This section, who would have thought 
  it, describes how you want to customize Iconnect to your needs:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <b>language=deutsch</b> : this should be obvious. Set it to language=english 
  to &quot;anglisize&quot; the little app. In order to &quot;translate&quot; Iconnect 
  into whatever language you like, have a look at the language.ini file: it has 
  two sections right now. Add &quot;your&quot; language as a section and translate 
  the few words you find there. Now you can add &quot;your&quot; language into 
  Iconnect.ini. If no language is specified here, Iconnect will speak english. 
  The &quot;help&quot;-button in Iconnect will currently only work with the &quot;build-in&quot; 
  languages. In order to make it work with &quot;your&quot; language as well, 
  you&acute;d have to translate this document into &quot;your language&quot; and 
  save it to the /Docs-directory. If you completely customized Iconnect to a lnguage 
  other than english or german, please let me know!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ExitClose=program1,program2,...</b> 
  : some programs really frown upon the request to close. In case you want to 
  automatically run one of those everytime you connect to the internet, it would 
  be a pity if it displayed a dialog daying &quot;Are you really, really sure 
  you want to close this wonderful program?&quot; (&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;) 
  - and no one would be there to marvel at it. Since this would stop your computer 
  from shutting down, you can tell Iconnect to close these programs <i>before</i> 
  shutting down your computer. Note that the name of the program(s) as they appear 
  in their main window don&acute;t have to be fully known; Iconnect will close 
  all windows where these names can be found. The entries of the list are separated 
  by a &quot;,&quot;.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AutoShutdown=0</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  or <b>1</b> :if &quot;0&quot;, Iconnect will quit leaving your computer ON. 
  If &quot;1&quot; (or, in fact anything larger than &quot;0&quot;) your computer 
  will shutdown when the following conditions apply</font>:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">dial up failed: it 
    took longer than the time specified in [Timer]Timer2 (default 5 minutes) to 
    connect to your ISP.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ftp upload failed: 
    it took longer than the time specified in [Connection]FTPTimeout (default 
    2 minutes) to connect your ftp-server.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ftp busy: if there 
    is only the data left to be send and the server won&acute;t respond, Iconnect 
    will retry (MaxRetries=) times before shutdown.</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">you couldn&acute;t 
    connect to your computer: if the &quot;reset countdown&quot; button is not 
    being pressed after [Timer]Timer2 (default 5 minutes).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> you lost an existing 
    connection: rest countdown was pressed, but [Timer]Timer3 (default 10 minutes) 
    expired.</font></li>
  <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">and finally, closing 
    the program (or clicking on &quot;close session&quot;) <i>after</i> it went 
    online shuts down your system, too.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">bottom line: if you&acute;re using 
  Iconnect to dial up your computer and connect to it, use AutoShutdown=1. If 
  your playing around with it&acute;s settings (or it&acute;s source code :-) 
  you might want to turn this option off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Optimize<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">=0</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  or <b>1</b> :if &quot;0&quot;, Iconnect will leave your windows wallpaper/desktop 
  pattern/fontsmoothing settings alone when connecting. If &quot;1&quot; (or anything 
  larger than &quot;0&quot;), it will turn all this off while connecting. This 
  is useful if your remotely using your computer via <a href="http://www.tridiavnc.com">WinVNC</a> 
  or something similar: the less data has to be transferred, the better the response 
  of your desktop. A single color background might not have as much impact on 
  performance than a lower <a href="#ScreenRes">screen resolution</a> but still 
  makes a huge difference.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>UseNetlaunch<a name="Netlaunch"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">=0</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  or <b>1</b> :Netlaunch is a wonderful little program. It sits in your systray 
  and makes every dial-up connection of your computer available at your fingertips. 
  You can launch or close programs before, when or after you connected. You can 
  schedule connections or interrupt them if they&acute;re too slow. All this for 
  a couple of KB of memory. It&acute;s freely available at <a href="http://www.blackcastlesoft.com">Blackcastle 
  Software</a> and, well, Iconnect works neatly with it :-) <b>highly recommended</b> 
  due to several err...irregularities in wininet.dll, which Iconnect would normally 
  use.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Netlaunch=(Program Path) </b>&quot;C:\Programme\NetLaunch&quot; 
  is an example path pointing to your Netlaunch folder. Since Netlaunch can be 
  &quot;installed&quot; like Iconnect, i.e. by simply extracting it into a program 
  folder, it leaves no &quot;trace&quot; in your registry. This in turn means, 
  if you want Iconnet to use it, you&acute;ll have to enter the path here. <b>Note:</b> 
  if <b>UseNetlaunch=1</b> and there is no path specified, Iconnect <i>must</i> 
  be in the same folder as Netlaunch. Makes sense, btw.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Server=<b>(Program Path)</b> </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;D:\Internet\Vnc\WinVNC.exe&quot; 
  is an example for an application to load after Iconnect has done it&acute;s 
  duty. This can be a *.bat file, vbscript, windows PWS (personal webserver) or 
  whatever you can think of (as long as the file specified here actually exists!).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Localport=0...65535 </b>: port 
  you want to connect to. Iconnect will create a default webpage where your computer 
  is linked like this: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;a href=&quot;http:127.0.0.1&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/a&gt;</font>. 
  Specifying a &quot;Localport=123&quot; has the following effect: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;a 
  href=&quot;http:127.0.0.1:123&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/a&gt;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
  Makes it easier to &quot;click and connect&quot;. 5800, as in the example, is 
  btw. the default port WinVNC listens to.</font></font></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ScreenRes<a name="ScreenRes"></a>=(width,height,bits 
  per pixel) </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: if you try 
  to connect with, say 1600*1200 Pixel in 32-Bit true-color, even the best connection 
  will be too slow to actually work smoothly with your computer. Worse, some remote-admin 
  tools (like IBM Desktop-On-Call 2.0, for instance) might crash straight away 
  if you bother them with more than 800*600. For a modem connection, a setting 
  like ScreenRes=800,600,16 gives good results - especially in connection with 
  Optimize=1. If all you want to do is to start your webserver, you can ommit 
  this option and thus use your normal screen setting. <b>Note:</b> Iconnect actually 
  <i>will </i>reduce your color-depth (bits per pixel) without rebooting. As a 
  result,<i> this will screw up your desktop colors</i>. Might look alarming (or 
  quite artistic if you go from, say, 1024,768,32 to 640,480,8) but is completely 
  harmless. In any case, your default screen settings will be restored before 
  the program quits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b><a name="Connection"></a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b>[Connection]</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ISP=(Service Provider)</b> : useful 
  only in connection with <a href="#Netlaunch">Netlaunch</a>. You can specifiy 
  your internet provider here as it appears in the Netlaunch menu (or rather, 
  like in your dial up connection window). In this case, you do not have to specifiy 
  any default provider as described in the <a href="#quickstart">quickstart</a>-section.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FTPHostname=(Name) </b>: name 
  of the ftp-server you want to upload your IP-address to. <b>Note:</b> there&acute;s 
  no leading ftp:// before the name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FTPUsername=(Name) </b>: login 
  name for that server.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FTPPassword=(Name)</b> : password 
  for your account, please.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FTPTimeout=(Time)</b> : default 
  0:2:0 (2 minutes). After connecting to the internet, Iconnect tries to contact 
  FTPHostname. It actually needs to establish 2 connections to this server: one 
  for sending and receiving data, and one for bossing it around. This should usually 
  work within a few seconds. If it takes more than 2 minutes for instance (FTPTimeout 
  default), it&acute;s definately better to stop trying.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>RemoteFile=(Name)</b> : file you 
  want to upload to the server. If a file with the same name <i>does not</i> <i>exist</i> 
  in your Iconnect folder, Iconnect will &quot;upload&quot; date, time and current 
  ip in an HTML-&quot;file&quot; that gets created only on the server. It&acute;ll 
  look like this:</font></p>
<p><img src="html01.gif" width="304" height="81"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is, however, a file called 
  &quot;template.htm&quot; in your Iconnect folder. It consists of the key-words 
  &quot;local date:&quot;, &quot;local time:&quot;, &quot;current ip&quot; and 
  a simple HTML-table. If the Name after &quot;RemoteFile=&quot; matches a file 
  in this folder, it will be uploaded to the server. Iconnect will <i>insert</i> 
  the correct date, time and IP after the appropriate &quot;key-words&quot; and 
  in addition fill up the table top to bottom with the data of your recent connections. 
  Thus, you can use Iconnect to display the most recent connections (or phonecalls) 
  to your computer. Since it will only do that if the table is empty, the actual 
  HTML-file can be as sophisticated as you want. The table can have as many (empty) 
  entries as you need, though once it is full you will have to empty it manually 
  since Iconnect will not overwrite any cells that are already filled. In short: 
  you can customize the HTML-page you actually upload to your hearts content; 
  if any of the key-words are missing, the corresponding data will not be published. 
  Feel free to experiment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>MaxRetries=(Number) </b>: number 
  of times Iconnect will try to persuade the ftp-server to cooperate <i>after</i> 
  the actual connection to it has been established. In other words, the whole 
  connection business can be summarized as: try to get <i>any</i> response from 
  the server until FTPTimeout. If you didn&acute;t, quit. If you did, try to login 
  and establish a data connection. If that fails, retry the whole thing &quot;MaxRetries&quot; 
  times. Default is 5. If that didn&acute;t work, quit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b><a name="timer"></a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b>[Timer]</b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Interval=(Number) </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: 
  Iconnect uses the standard timer event in Windows. You can specifiy here, how 
  often this will occur. Interval is in ms. The shorter the interval (the lower 
  the number), the more accurate the timing of Iconnect gets. Of course, that 
  means more system resources as well. The default (300) actually works so well 
  that I am beginning to wonder why I left the option to change it in there. Well...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Timer1=(Time)</b> : Countdown 
  <i>before</i> dial up. Default 5 seconds. If you put a link to Iconnect into 
  your &quot;Autostart&quot;-folder of your start menu, you propably don&acute;t 
  want to really go online every time you boot up your computer while your modem 
  is on. If your modem is off, nothing will happen anyway. But if you&acute;re 
  like me, you propably power on your computer using any odd switch: be it the 
  modem, the space-bar...just don&acute;t forget to hit &quot;enter&quot; if you 
  see Iconnect appearing on your screen. Especially if AutoShutdown is turned 
  ON. I suggest setting it to a minute or so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Timer2=(Time)</b> : Countdown 
  <i>after</i> Iconnect has uploaded your HTML-&quot;page&quot;. Default 5 minutes. 
  If you know how long it takes for your computer to boot (say, 1 minute 30 seconds) 
  and for the upload to be finished (max. 30 seconds) this gives you a &quot;time-window&quot; 
  of 2 to 7 minutes to connect to your computer until you see your desktop and 
  press &quot;enter&quot;. Iconnect will hop diligently into your taskbar and 
  sit there until 10 seconds before the countdown is over. If you get phonecalls 
  very often, but actually connect your computer very rarely, reducing this time 
  might be a good idea. Your phone bill will thank you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Timer3=(Time)</b> : Countdown 
  after the first reset of the &quot;stopwatch&quot;. Default 10 minutes. Every 
  10 minutes, Iconnect will pop up again, 10 seconds before the countdown expires, 
  and ask for you to hit &quot;enter&quot; again. In case for whatever reason 
  that doesn&acute;t happen, you&acute;ll be propably grateful to know your computer 
  won&acute;t stay online.</font></p>
